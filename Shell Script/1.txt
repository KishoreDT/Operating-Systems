An operating system is software that manages a computer’s hardware. It
also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary
between the computer user and the computer hardware. An amazing aspect
of operating systems is how they vary in accomplishing these tasks in a wide
variety of computing environments. Operating systems are everywhere, from
cars and home appliances that include “Internet of Things” devices, to smart
phones, personal computers, enterprise computers, and cloud computing envi-
ronments.
